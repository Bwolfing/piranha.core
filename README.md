# Welcome to Piranha.Core

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/brw0cak0b5x4w17m?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/tidyui/piranha-core)

This is a **complete rewrite** of Piranha CMS for the `DotNetCore` & `Entity Framework Core`. The goal is to create a platform independent version with minimal depenencies, but still provide tight integration with the services available in **Windows Azure** such as `Blob Storage` & `Media Services`.

Piranha.Core is currently built for dotnet core `1.1.0` and uses the following packages:

* AutoMapper `5.1.1`
* Markdown `2.2.0`
* Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore `1.1.0`
* Microsoft.AspNetCore `1.1.0`
* Newtonsoft.Json `9.0.1`
* NETStandard.Library `1.6.1`
